# Object-Oriented-C-Project-2022---Pok-mon-game
A simple C++ game inspired by classic Pokémon style battles. The player selects a monster, each with unique stats, types, and moves, and fights through four turn based battles across different terrains. Each terrain includes weather effects that boost or weaken certain move types, adding strategy to combat.

The project demonstrates core object oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, aggregation, arrays of objects, overloaded functions, and encapsulation.

Features:

Choose from three starter monsters with unique attributes

Six enemy monsters with different types and move sets

Turn based battle system (attack, scan, flee)

Terrain + weather effects that modify move damage

Type advantages/weaknesses (e.g., Fire → Grass ×2, Water → Fire ×2)

Win all four battles to complete the game

Classes Included:

Monster — stats, type, moves

Moveset — name, type, damage

Terrain — environment, weather, strengths/weaknesses

Battle — combat logic, effectiveness, flee chance
